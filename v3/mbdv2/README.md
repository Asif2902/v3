### Important Notice

This version is focused on UI with Static Blockchain Functionalities

This project includes both:

The User Interface (UI) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Basic Blockchain functionalities — meaning, the core blockchain-related operations work, but the app is mostly static in terms of layout and structure.



✔️ The blockchain interactions (such as wallet connections, smart contract calls, etc.) are functional.
❌ However, the layout and design are in an early phase — expect a static structure with limited responsiveness or dynamic content.

Key Points:

The current version showcases:

UI Design and Layout

Working Blockchain operations (e.g., Wallet connect, Read/Write contract calls)

Static structure (not fully dynamic, no responsive adjustments in some parts)


What’s NOT included yet:

Final design polish

Full responsive behavior for all screen sizes

Backend integration beyond blockchain (if needed)

Dynamic data from external APIs (excluding blockchain interactions)




---

Summary:

✅ Blockchain features functional
✅ Static UI structure for visual review
✅ Smart contract interactions available
🚧 Still under development — final version will include improved layout, full responsiveness, and possibly more features.

Note: If you're testing this, focus on both:

Visual Layout (static for now)

Blockchain-related functionalities
